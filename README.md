# Plant-AI
classifying plant diseases using base CNN models, CNN models with augmentation and transfer learning using VGG16

Data Description
This dataset contains images of unique plants belonging to 12 different species.
The data file names are:
images.npy
Label.csv
Due to the large volume of data, the images were converted to numpy arrays and stored in images.npy file and the corresponding labels are also put into Labels.csv so that you can work on the data/project seamlessly without having to worry about the high data volume.
The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from an image.

List of Plant species:
Black-grass
Charlock
Cleavers
Common Chickweed
Common Wheat
Fat Hen
Loose Silky-bent
Maize
Scentless Mayweed
Shepherds Purse
Small-flowered Cranesbill
Sugar beet
